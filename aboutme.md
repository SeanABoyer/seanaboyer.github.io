title: About me
---
My name is Sean Boyer and I enjoy solving problems. I enjoy gaming(video and board games), coding, bowling, and ultimate frisbee. I grew up as a military child with the dream of becoming a pilot. While that did not happen, I still enjoy avaition and will always try to grab the window seat on a flight. 

## Education
I went to a small University in San Antonio Texas where I studied for a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems and Security. During college I participated in and later was the president of our AITP (Association of Information Technology Professionals) organization. I competed in multiple competitions while in college (anything from Database Design, to Security, to Application Development), placing in some regional competitions and honorable mention in others. My university had a small rack of servers and network gear, where I built an air gapped pen-testing lab for the students in our organization to train their red team skills for these security competitions. 

## Career
During school I worked part time at the University's help desk. After a year at the help desk I moved to be a Student Assistant System Administrator, where I took manual tasks like "Create XXX guest accounts" and tried my best to automate them (and design a process). I also assisted with a sub domain for student VM's and assisted in automating where possible with PowerCLI.

During my summers I attended internships; My first internship I built a REST API for a mobile application and designed a dashboard for QA teams to better visualize metrics for active projects. My second internship I used docker to run automated selenium tests, to provide quantative metrics around user expierence from different parts of the world.

After graduating I began working as a Software Developer, supporting ServiceNow and an in house C# application to support service desk employees. A majority of my time was spent extending ServiceNow, as my team supported Major Incident, Problem, Incident and Knowledge processes, as well as some scoped applications.

I later moved and began working as a Software Developer within another company where my team supports Enterprise Monitoring and ServiceNow. Here, I have been able to extend my knowledge of ServiceNow as we have begun going as close to out of box for all ITSM processes. I have also been able to extend my knowledge on how ServiceNow intergrates with other platforms like ScienceLogic, VRealize Suite, and others as we begin to automate infrastrcuture where possible. 


## My Free Time
In my free time I enjoy playing video games and board games with friends. I host a bi-weekly board game night with friends and enjoy strategic games the most (I suggest giving [Robo Rally](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) a try). I enjoy learning how things work and often will start side projects at home to better understand the inner workings. I have recently began digging into UI/UX, trying to understand best practices, while reading books like [The Human Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface). I have taken a break from Bowling, but look to get back into it soon!
